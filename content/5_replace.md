To do simpler actions like finding and replacing a limited set in naming variances like we need to do in the `pubtype` column:

   - Select the dropdown menu of the `pubtype` column.
   - **Apply Transformations**: 
     - Choose **Edit cells** > **Transformâ€¦** to open the transformation dialog.
     - Use the following GREL expression to perform multiple replacements in one step:
       ```grel
       if(value == "Master Gardener", "Master Gardener Program Handbook",
       if(value == "Pacific Northwest Extension", "Pacific Northwest Extension Publications", value))
       ```
     - **Explanation**:
       - The expression checks if the cell contains "Master Gardener" and changes it to "Master Gardener Program Handbook."
       - If it contains "Pacific Northwest Extension," it will be replaced with "Pacific Northwest Extension Publications."
       - Otherwise, the cell value remains unchanged.
     - Click **OK** to apply the transformation.
