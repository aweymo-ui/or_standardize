Practical guide to using OpenRefine for metadata language standardization intended for faculty, staff, patrons and students at U of I. The focus of this workshop is to provide *only* the steps you need to perform these tasks. There is a mountain of other functionalities this tool has to offer and, if you are interested, I highly recommend my colleague [Evan Williamson's](https://evanwill.github.io/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} multiple OpenRefine workshops!
