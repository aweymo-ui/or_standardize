Minimal tutorial on using OpenRefine for metadata language standardization for faculty, staff, patrons and students at U of I. The focus of this work has been to provide only the steps you need to perform these tasks. There is a mountain of other functionalities this tool has to offer and, if you are interested, I highly recommend my colleague [Evan Williamson's](https://evanwill.github.io/) multiple OpenRefine workshops!
